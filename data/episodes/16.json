As she and Dorothy head for space separately, so do Heero and Sally, taking along the Wing Zero and Trowa's Gundam Heavyarms (which Sally has recovered). When Duo, Trowa, Quatre, and Noin intervene in the White Fang's attack on Barge in hopes of finding out why Zechs has declared war against Earth, he makes his intentions clear by singlehandedly destroying Barge with the Epyon's beam sword.",
