    "synopsis": "During a field trip at Tokyo Tower, three girls from three different schools are transported to a medieval-like land named Cephiro. The girls introduce themselves as Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki and Fuu Hououji, who are all in the 8th grade regardless of how they look. They are then greeted by a wizard named Clef. Clef explains that their ruler, Princess Emeraude, was imprisoned by the High Priest, Zagato, high above the skies of Cephiro. Clef explains that their world was never like this before, that it is stable with Princess Emeraude's prayers holding everything together. He then explains that Princess Emeraude made it clear they are Legendary Magic Knights, who are destined to save their world. He then explains that they cannot leave until they fulfill the Princess' wish. Clef asks if they can use magic; when they say they can not, he grants it to them and begins teaching them. Watching from his fortress, Zagato sends Alcyone to stop the Magic Knights. Clef sees Alcyone, and she attacks. He blocks the attack and fends off Alcyone as he sends the girls away on a griffin. His last command is for them to go west to the Forest of Silence, to Presea's home. Alcyone goes after them, while Clef thinks about how they would do against Zagato. At that moment, Zagato shows up and fires a spell at Clef. Clef is turned into stone, and Zagato's spell breaks the ground around him. Clef begins to fall off the cliff. Alcyone charges towards the three. After a few attacks, Hikaru finally stands up and uses her \"Fire Arrow\" spell to defeat Alcyone.",

    "title": "Presea, the Master Smith in the Forest of Silence",
    "airDate": "1994-10-24",
    "synopsis": "Guided by Clef's words stuck in their head, they reach the Forest of Silence. They are dropped off by the griffin, and wonder how they'll get into the mansion, because it is surrounded by a wall with no doors. Fuu suggests knocking. Umi is very skeptical, but when Hikaru starts to knock on the wall, a door opens. They try to call for someone, but no one greets them. They have small argument about not being rude, and decide to enter without permission. They do not know it, but a monster crawling in the ground gets in behind them. The door shuts and they enter the mansion. They wander around a bit, until they hear noise coming from a room. It turns out to be a library, and they see a mess coming from someone behind the chair. They ask if the person is Presea, but when the chair turns around, it turns out that the \"person\" is a small rabbit-like creature called Mokona. Suddenly a cage drops on them, and a woman comes forward. The woman is extremely happy, thinking she's captured Mokona, the creature that has been always messing up her study. After thinking of ways to punish Mokona, she looks in the cage and is surprised to see three girls in it. Umi starts to complain about how it is not their fault they were captured since the women, whom they have figured out is Presea, did not answer the door. She explains how Hikaru just knocked and the door opened by itself. Presea is surprised, and tells them only the Legendary Magic Knights could have done that. The monster soon finds them and starts to attack them. Presea manages to let them escape from the cage, and Hikaru tries using her magic to kill it. But the magic does not work and they scream in fear. Presea then draws out her sword and slices the monster's head off. Presea then brings them to a room filled with weapons, since they obviously need them to fight back. After thinking they had to pay for them, Presea reveals she is just \"loaning\" the weapons to them... no charge. She then explains that for them to become true Magic Knights, they need to go to the Spring of Eterna to pick up the legendary ore, Escudo. What they did not know is that the monster was not killed, and it comes for them again. Presea closes the huge door and tells them to pick a weapon. The girls close their eyes, and they successfully choose their weapons. Both Hikaru and Umi gets swords (Hikaru's is a broadsword and Umi's is a rapier), while Fuu get a bow and arrows. The monster then breaks through the door. They try to kill it and manage to break it up into pieces. It then reassembles itself, and Fuu tells them it is probably made of mud. Hikaru then gets an idea for how to kill it. She asks Presea if they have a pond. Presea says there is one in the back, and the four of them head for it. Hikaru asks if she can use the table cloth as they pass through the kitchen. Presea tells her yes, as they head for the back. Outside Hikaru tells them to distract the monster as she hides behind a pillar. Umi and Fuu does so and Hikaru throws the cloth over the monster's head. Hikaru charges forward, knocking the monster in the pond, where it proceeds to die. They then get another surprise when the weapons suddenly disappear into their jewels on their gloves. Presea then tells them that the weapons will only appear when they are needed. Outside the wall, Presea tells them to go to Eterna. She then tells them they will be guided by Mokona, who knows they way. They part ways for now, and Presea hopes the Legendary Magic Knights save their land. The episode ends with Presea praying that the Princess is watching over the trio.",

Ferio then offers to be their guide to get out of the Forest of Silence. They say no, and try to lose him, but he still follows them. The girls then discuss about him being their guide, but they can not trust him, due to the fact he is still a stranger.

We then find out that Ferio was an entertainer, and Princess Emeraude saved his life when guards thought he stole in the castle. Princess Emeraude then told the guards that it was a gift to him. That is why he is on the quest to save Princess Emeraude. They then take rest in a large tent/room, thanks to Mokona. Hikaru wants to give Ferio food, who is outside, but Fuu tells Hikaru she'll do it. The reason is, Hikaru is too kind, and might invite him in to stay with them. Outside, Fuu gives him the food, and Ferio asks her to stay with him while he eats. She blushes and rushes back in. The next day, they look upon a lot of monsters surrounding a rock.

A water monster then attacks them from the lake and Umi destroys it with her Water Dragon. The water that formed the monster rains on them as it falls apart, making them glow, and they brush off the glowing as they dry off. They head for Eterna, as Alcyone watches from afar, laughing to herself. They arrive at the place that Mokona says is Eterna, but they do not see anything other than a line floating in midair. Mokona wanders off to climb a pillar of rock and Hikaru follows. Hikaru calls to Umi and Fuu from the top of the rock pillar, saying that they have to see something. Umi and Fuu join her and are surprised to see a spring from the top of the rock. Fuu realizes that Eterna is a two-dimensional spring--you can see the spring from above, but from the side, it looks like a line. Mokona jumps into the spring and they follow him to get the Escudo. The girls are separated as they fall further into the spring, and each of them sees someone they care about greatly. Hikaru sees her dog, Hikari, Umi sees her parents, and Fuu sees herself. The girls are attacked by their loved ones, and would not fight back. They then hear Princess Emeraude's voice, asking them to consider if they are truly facing their loved ones. The girls all figure out that it is not actually their loved ones in front of them, and destroy the images with new spells. Hikaru gains the spell Red Lighting, Umi gains the spell Blue Tornado, and Fuu gains the spell Green Gale. As the images disappear, each girl has a piece of Escudo appear in front of her. They are excited, but they get an unexpected visitor... Alcyone. The girls then abruptly drop to the floor. Alcyone explains her water monster had a slow-acting poison in it. She then says that she has come for the Escudo, because only the Magic Knights would have been able to get it. The Escudo then rushes into their glove jewels and their armor gets upgraded. They then use their new spells to send Alcyone back. Then they head back to Presea, as she will make their new weapons to awaken the legendary Rune Gods. Alcyone begs for another chance, but Zagato sends her off, and sends Ascot off for his chance to kill the Magic Knights.",

Meanwhile, the girls are traveling to the volcano-like shrine to revive Hikaru's Rune-God, only to be attacked by a large flying bird. They try to fight it off with their swords, but it is of no use. It then takes a hold of Umi, who loses her swords and flies off with her. Fuu tries to return Umi her sword, but Umi's sword turns into water when Fuu tries to pick it up. Fuu only has one choice, and throws her own sword to Umi. Umi catches it, but is too heavy. She tries to hold onto it, but drops it instead. The bird continues to fly, and a man appears and kills the bird. Hikaru and Fuu catch Umi, and she comments how heavy Fuu's sword is. Fuu then holds it, noting it is as light as a feather to her. Then they soon realize that the swords have been made specially for each other, and them alone. Anyone else who tries to use them would not be able to. Once she is recovered Umi wishes to thank the man who rescued her, and they see Lafarga standing before them. He then proceeds to attack them, and manages to trap Umi and Fuu.

    "synopsis": "Aska summons a multitude of swords and hurls them at Fuu, who easily defends herself with her magic. She holds Aska with a gust of wind and requests her belongings back. Fuu apologizes to Aska for binding her and asks why she's come to Cephiro. Aska says that becoming the Pillar will give her the power to do whatever she wishes and become as beautiful as Emeraude. Fuu explains the enormous responsibility that rests on the Pillar's shoulders, saying she won't be able to fall in love with anyone and that Cephiro will crumble if she ever doubts herself. Ferio suddenly bursts in and takes Fuu away. He fights his way through Aska's ninjas and escapes the Dome with Fuu on the back of a giant bird. Fuu's words, however, make Aska think. Ferio and Fuu share a tender moment, which is interrupted when Fuu senses Hikaru's distress. Meanwhile, Hikaru is still trapped in her mind along with Nova, who bombards her with energy beams. Nova says she loves Hikaru so much because Hikaru hates herself, much to her shock. Nova moves to kiss her when Sierra manages to communicate with Hikaru and give her courage by reminding her of all the people she's fighting for. Hikaru, having found the strength to react, recreates her sword and defeats Nova. Finally free, Hikaru returns to Cephiro and she confesses her feelings to Lantis. Umi and Fuu both sense Hikaru's return when Debonair appears in front of everyone. She says that her power comes from the despair of the inhabitants of Cephiro. Debonair attacks Umi but Ascot takes the hit for her. She then attacks Fuu and Ferio, her blast easily breaking through Fuu's barrier spell. As she prepares one massive attack, Clef tells Umi and Fuu to synchronize with his heart. They do and are teleported back to the palace. Debonair says the land will soon belong to her eternally.",
